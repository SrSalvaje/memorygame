#Udacity Front-End Web Development Scolarship

This repository is the third project of the course.

It was made with vanilla CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

The starter code for html and basic css was provided by udacity but rewrote by me to use CSS grid instead of flexbox. 

The background image was provided by Udacity, the fonts for the card icons are font awesome from [bootstrap]( https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css
)

The shuffling funtion used to randomize the deck was taken from [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976)

The rest of the code is written by me. 

Dependencies:

Awesome Fonts: https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css
Google Fonts: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coda
